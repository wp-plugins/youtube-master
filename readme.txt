Youtube Master displays Youtube Playlists or Single Videos with optional Youtube Subscribe Channel button in any template widget position.

== Description ==

The perfect wordpress plugin if you have a sales or multimedia (video, music clips) content website. Why?, this plugin was specially designed and coded in Html5, no errors or conflicts with light speed page loading times, a must for any video display.

With YouTube Master you can display Youtube videos in any wordpress template widget position... have you ever seen those sales websites with a great commercial showing of the product, instead of boring text or static images... well, this is it for wordpress.

But that's not all, we packed the html5 with the ability to show a single video or a full youtube playlist. If you are a video or sound enthusiast that would like to display professionally your work, the youtube playlist feature is definitely for you. To top it off, we added full control over the width and height of the videos, it will fit perfectly in any space you have available, no matter how big or small.

If you have an Youtube Channel, we also added an optional Youtube Subscribe Channel button under the video player that will make your channel grow exponentially.

Both the widget and the shortcode framework are fully mobile devices responsive, a must for any professional website.
